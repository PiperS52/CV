Previously in healthcare/life sciences consulting, my role required designing and building out health economic models and analytics tools for major pharma clients, in order to help shape their commercial market access strategy. Seeking a new direction while also acting on my interest in tech, I recently graduated from Makers Academy, where I'm now looking for a Junior Software Engineering position, in which I can extend my programming skills alongside my enthusiasm for creative problem-solving.

**Tech Skills:** Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Python, HTML, CSS, JQuery, SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite), MongoDB, R, React

## Skills

#### Problem-solver

In my previous position, I was required to manipulate and analyse datasets in modelling complex client problems, to be able to design and build bespoke health economics solutions.

#### Fast learner

During my time at Makers I have regularly been presented with the challenge of quickly getting to grips with new programming languages, frameworks and testing suites. An example of my intention to be continuously learning is that of the final group project at Makers, where we chose to use a previously unused MERN stack, to build out a fully functioning web app in two weeks.

#### Effective communicator

As the go-to consultant and engineer for a global bespoke technology data analytics pilot tool with a top 6 pharma client, I was tasked with leading client discussions, as well as presenting to global client decision makers to help deliver key insights. Furthermore, the role involved a high level of regular engagement with different teams across the business in different geographies.

#### Adaptable

Consulting gave me an appreciation for the evolutionary nature of a project lifecycle, and the need to respond to and implement client requests with alacrity. During my time at Makers, I also had the opportunity to work in an agile environment, acting on new feedback and requirements across two-day sprints, to build out new app features.

- Statistical Programming & Data Science:
    * Stata
    * R (tidyverse, caret, R Markdown)
